=================
This folder was created to store the large dataset for creation of map layer.
However, the dataset is too big to upload to Github. Thus, only the data source is listed here.
Our current development is using Australia Wind Power Density data and global solar irradiation data which can be download from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mtH_evyiBC0kgZiA23ROwWvUPP2KmC6z?usp=sharing)
